The code is divided into two parts:
The notebook NN_Network is the primary code which houses the neural network and all the code required to run it. The path for the folder would need to be changes in order for the code to work.
The Neural Network code file however is required to create folder in the format required by the NN_Network Code. The code requires folders containing all the images in one file. 
To run the file first change the paths in the Neural Network code file, then run it to create the new folders. Then change the paths in the NN_Network file and run the notebook to get the results.
